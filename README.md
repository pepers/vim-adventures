### Readme
[Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is an excellent educational game by Doron Linder.  It focuses on teaching many popular commands and motions used in the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor.  Here are a few disclaimers: 
- My solutions may not be the only way, and may not even be the optimal way to solve the puzzles.
- I strongly suggest you attempt all levels on your own before turning to the following spoilers.
