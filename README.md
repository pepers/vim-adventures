### Readme
[Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is an excellent educational game by Doron Linder.  It focuses on teaching many popular commands and motions used in the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor.  Here are a few disclaimers: 
- My solutions may not be the only way, and may not even be the optimal way to solve the puzzles.
- I strongly suggest you attempt all levels on your own before turning to the following spoilers.

- Big Bug fight
   - search for 'Uganda', 'Bram', and 'Charity' to kill the smaller bugs (those are their hidden names)
      - eg: `?Uganda<Enter>` or `/Uganda<Enter>`  
      - you can repeat searches in the underground buffer with `/<Enter>` and `?<Enter>`
      - big bug moves fast so using repeated searches is very helpful
      - moving between the corners with gg and G$ will give you the most time to run the search commands before big bug gets to you 
      - when you kill one, it won't come back, so keep going back to the underground buffer until you kill all three, then focus on Big Bug
   - to hurt Big Bug you must use undo (`u`) and redo (`CTRL-R`), which will cause a lightning strike where edits were made
      - type `99u` and `99<CTRL-R>` to do lots of damage at once
      - if you die, Big Bug regains health, so you must be quick and use motions like `gg`, `G`, `0`, and `$` to dodge around
      - you can spam `{` and `}` to go from corner to corner
      - this will force him to cross edited text when he scrapes along the top and bottom of the screen for easy damage
      - take Big Bug's health to zero, and he will die
   - Congratulations!  `<CTRL-R>` repeatedly to redo all the changes, and then the final cutscene will happen
- THE END!
